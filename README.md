# space-invaders

The READMEs should include:

○ Link to your project

https://acadonis.github.io/space-invaders/

○ Brief

Create a Space Invaders game, with the ability to clear a single wave of aliens and display a player's score at the end of the game as MVP. 

Additional features included responsive design, increasing difficulty levels and a persistant leaderboard.

○ Overview & concept of the project

My overall approach was to remain faithful to the original's core concept of balance between destroying aliens and staying alive, and being required to take risks to do so.    

○ Technologies used

HTML5, CSS 3, ES6, SASS, Git, Github

○ Approach taken - Thought process & methods of producing it

○ Snippets of your code and screenshots of your project

○ Wins and Blockers

○ Future features

○ What you have learned (tech & soft skills)
